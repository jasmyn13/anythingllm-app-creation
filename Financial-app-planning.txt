Step 1: Plan and Design Your App

*   Define the features and functionality you want in your personal finance tracker:
    *   User input (e.g., adding, editing, deleting expenses)
    *   Data storage (e.g., saving expenses to a file or database)
    *   Basic calculations (e.g., displaying total expenses, calculating average expense)
*   Sketch out a simple wireframe or user interface to help visualize your app’s layout and interactions

Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

*   Install the necessary extensions in VS Code:
    *   AnythingLM: This is the AI-powered code completion and suggestion tool. Make sure to install the AnythingLM extension in VS Code.
    *   Docker: If you plan to use Docker to containerize your app, install the Docker extension in VS Code.
*   Create a new project in VS Code and choose a language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, or TypeScript)

Step 3: Choose a Data Storage Solution

*   Decide on a data storage solution for your app:
    *   File-based storage: Save expenses to a JSON or CSV file
    *   Database: Use a lightweight database like SQLite or MongoDB
    *   Cloud storage: Use a cloud-based storage service like Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3
*   If using a database, you may need to install a database driver or library (e.g., sqlite3 for Python or psql for PostgreSQL)

Step 4: Write Your Code

*   Start writing your code using AnythingLM’s AI-powered suggestions and completion features:
    *   Define functions for user input (e.g., `addExpense`, `editExpense`)
    *   Implement data storage logic (e.g., saving expenses to a file or database)
    *   Calculate basic statistics (e.g., total expenses, average expense)
*   Use VS Code’s built-in debugging tools to test and iterate on your code

Step 5: Containerize Your App with Docker (Optional)

*   If you want to containerize your app using Docker:
    *   Install Docker on your system
    *   Create a `Dockerfile` that defines the build process for your app
    *   Build a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`
    *   Run the Docker container using the `docker run` command
*   Note: Docker is not strictly necessary for this project, but it can help with deployment and scaling your app in the future

Step 6: Test and Refine Your App

*   Test your app thoroughly to ensure it works as expected:
    *   Test user input and data storage logic
    *   Verify basic calculations and statistics
    *   Refine your app’s UI and user experience as needed

Here’s some sample code to get you started with a simple personal finance tracker using JavaScript and the AnythingLM extension:

    
    javascriptCopy block
    // Import required libraries
    const fs = require('fs');
    const readline = require('readline');
    
    // Define a function to add an expense
    function addExpense
